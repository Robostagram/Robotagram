# Robotagram 

**Robotagram** is a project of an online multiplayer board game made by a bunch of guys locked in an attic for two days.
The game is made in Scala and Play 2 for the backend and jQuery and Twitter Bootstrap for the UI. The game is [playable on heroku](http://robotagram.herokuapp.com/).

## How to play
Log into the game and try to make the right robot to reach its goal. A robot can only go in a straight line and stop only when it hits a wall or another robot.
