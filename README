# Robotagram #

Robotagram is a project of an online multiplayer board game made by a bunch of guys locked in an attic for two days.
The game is made in scala and play 2 for the backend and jQuery and TwitterBootstrap for the UI. The game is [playable on heroku](http://robotagram.herokuapp.com/).

## How to play ##
Log into the game and try to make the right robot to reach its goal. A robot can only go in a straight line and stop only when it hits a wall or another robot.
